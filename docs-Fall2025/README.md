# GGCMaps - 8/25/2025

## Team Lot

### Description / Abstract
  - The GGC Maps Project is a web-based tool that helps students, visitors, and staff navigate Georgia Gwinnett College’s campus. It rebuilds the legacy GGC Maps app using a modern framework to ensure responsiveness, accessibility, and easier maintenance. The new system will reuse existing SVG floorplans and JSON data while adding support for modular plug-ins, making it extensible for future features. The project’s primary objective is to deliver a clean, maintainable, and future-proof mapping solution for GGC.

### Links
 - The [legacy GGC Maps project](http://ggcmaps.com/#Campus) is available for reference, but this repository focuses on rebuilding it with modern frameworks and a modular design.

### Technologies
- JavaScript framework (Next.js, React or Vue.js – pending final decision)
- HTML5 / CSS3 for layout and styling
- SVG for scalable building maps
- JSON for room and building metadata
- GitHub for version control and collaboration

### Working Features
- Display of campus buildings and indoor maps (from SVG files)
- Clickable rooms and spaces with highlights
- Search by room number or building
- Overlay features (e.g., fire escapes, elevators, vending machines)
- Modular plugin system for future extensions (e.g., accessibility overlays, GPS integration) 

### Installation Steps


### Running Steps


### Other Project Explanations
